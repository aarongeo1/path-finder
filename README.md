# path finder 

## An Indrodution to Tangible Computing Course work where I had to find the shortest path from one point to another using the coordinates given to us of the map of edmonton

* Done using the djikstras algorithm for shortest path

* ***pipelines were used for the GUI, Not part of this repository because it was created by the professor and _not by me_***
